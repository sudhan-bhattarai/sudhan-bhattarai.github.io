      Warm Greetings,
    </p>
    <p class="main">
      I’m a master’s student of <b>Industrial & Systems Engineering</b> at <a style="color:blue" href="https://www.csupueblo.edu/engineering/index.html" target="_blank"> <i>Colorado State University-Pueblo</i></a> (CSU-P). I'm also working as a
      <i> Graduate Assistant </i> at CSU-P. I will be graduating in May 2021. I completed my undergraduate study in <b>Industrial Engineering</b> from <a style = "color: blue" href = "https://ioe.edu.np/" target = "_blank"> <i>Tribhuvan University, Nepal</i></a> in 2017. Following are the areas of
      my research interest:
    </p>
    <ul class="indented" align="left">
      <li> Operations research & optimization </li>
      <li> Artificial intelligence & machine learning </li>
      <li> Data science & analytics </li>
      <li> Healthcare applications </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="main">
      I like programming. I primarily use <a style="color:blue" href="https://www.gurobi.com/" target="_blank">Gurobi </a> for optimization and Python for data science & machine learning. I also use other languages based on requirements
      of the problem. My sample projects are listed in <a style="color:blue" href="https://github.com/sudhan-bhattarai?tab=repositories"> <i> GitHub Repositories </i> </a>.
    </p>
    <p class="main">
      Moreover, I am a learner. I prefer to work in a demanding environment as it helps me to reinforce my creativity. Furthermore, I enjoy exploring new problems, underlying challenges, and solution techniques. Also, knowledge sharing is a passion for me and I am always looking forward to build a
      good coordination with my teammates. I have confidence on my capabilities, my learning attitude, my leadership quality, my endurance, and my willingness to put my best efforts on work. In other words, I'm confident that I can accomplish anything I desire from deep within.
    </p>
    <p class="main">
      Apart from my professional/academic life, I enjoy sports. Football (soccer) is my favorite. For recreation, I mostly spend time with friends, go to the gym, go out on hikes, and also play video games. Last but not least, I like to be around friendly people with a good sense of humor.
      Please browse my profile to find more of my details.
